# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
    Conditionals allow you to kind of sort inquiries into categories where you can execute code depending on whether
    or not the given infomation satisfies them.  Like following a choose your own adventure.  You can set up multiple pathways
    with various executable steps and the inputs work their way down until they match the conditions you've set.  At that point
    the code executes.

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
    I would have done it sooner.  Not because I feel particularly behind, but because this kind of simplified repetition is
    one of the things that helps hammer these concepts into my brain.

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
    The assignments and the repetition were extremely useful, but more than that the stuggles I went through reconnecting
    my GitHub repos was more useful.  I honestly could still use more help with that.
